        <h1>So you want to shape a graph...</h1>

<p>Imagine sitting on your computer in desperate need for a graph. You toss and you turn – where do I get a realistic graph? <strong>Graphshaper</strong> to the rescue – your all-in-one solution for generating scale-free networks.</p>

<h2>Why would I ever want to do that?</h2>

<p>I created this gem for my bachelor thesis, where I will implement certain graph algorithms in the new NoSQL database <a href="http://www.avocadodb.org">AvocadoDB</a>. I will compare the performance to existing solutions, therefore I need the same graph in different database systems. And – of course – I need some pretty pictures for my thesis, so I included an export to PNG via dot.</p>

<h2>What do you mean when you say realistic?</h2>

<p>If you would generate a bunch of vertices and then connect them with vertices at random, you don't get a realistic network. Most real world, large networks follow the power-law in their node distribution. To generate a graph that has the same attributes, <strong>graphshaper</strong> uses an algorithm based upon the Barabási-Albert model introduced by R. Albert and A.-L. Barabási in 2002.</p>

<h2>Ok, and how would I generate a graph now?</h2>

<p>First you would install <strong>graphshaper</strong> from ruby gems. You can either do that via <code>gem install graphshaper</code> or – in your bundler file – via <code>gem 'graphshaper', '~&gt; 0.2.2'</code>.
You can either use <strong>graphshaper</strong> via the command line or in your Ruby code as a library. For the latter I refer you to the <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/moonglum/graphshaper">documentation</a>. The commandline tool expects one argument: The number of vertices you want your generated graph to have. This is how to use it:</p>

<pre><code>graphshaper [options] size
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>-a</code>, <code>--avocado</code>: Store the graph in a local AvocadoDB instance</li>
<li>
<code>-l</code>, <code>--log</code>: Store the graph in two CSV files for nodes and edges</li>
<li>
<code>-d</code>, <code>--dot</code>: Store the graph in the dot format</li>
<li>
<code>-p</code>, <code>--png</code>: Export the graph as a PNG (you need to install graphviz for that – circo is used for the layout)</li>
<li>
<code>--version</code>: Show version</li>
</ul><h2>Format Support</h2>

<p>Currently you can only export the graph to CSV, AvocadoDB and the dot format. You can of course use the CSV files to import them into any system, but I will also add support for more systems (MySQL and Neo4j) very soon. If you need any other format or system, feel free to send me a (well rspec'ed) pull request :)</p>
